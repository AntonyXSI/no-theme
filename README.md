# No Theme for Oxygen

This theme only serves as a placeholder for sites built with [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/).

Oxygen completely disables the WordPress theme system, so it really doesn't matter which theme you have installed.

However, theme update notifications will come through for themes that are installed. It can be annoying to you and confusing for clients.

1. Act as blank placeholder theme that will receive no update notices.
2. Gives Oxygen user opportunity to include contact details incase a new developer takes on the project and has no information on who built the site.

## Installation ##

1. [Download the theme here.](https://github.com/wplit/no-theme/archive/master.zip)
2. Go to Themes > Add New in your WordPress admin. Click on `Upload Theme` and browse for the zip file.
3. Activate the Theme.
4. Change style.css file to include your contact details.
